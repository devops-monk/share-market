        <div className="space-y-3">
          <Step num={1} title="Morning: Check the Overview (2 min)" page="/">
            Look at the <strong className="t-primary">Market Regime</strong> (bull/correction/bear) and the
            bullish vs bearish count. If the market is in bear mode, don't buy aggressively.
            Check if any of your watchlist stocks made big moves overnight.

          <Step num={2} title="Morning: Scan Bearish Alerts (2 min)" page="/bearish">

          <Step num={3} title="Morning: Check Economic Calendar (1 min)" page="/economic-calendar">
            See if any major events are today (FOMC, CPI, NFP). If yes, expect volatility — don't make
            big trades until after the event. These events can swing the entire market 1-3% in an hour.

            Look at your open positions (Holdings + Paper Trading). Any stock down more than 7-8% from your buy price?

        <p className="t-tertiary text-sm mb-4">
          Paper trading gives you <strong className="t-primary">$100,000 in virtual cash</strong> to practice buying and selling stocks.
          Prices are real — only the money is fake. It's the safest way to learn.
        </p>
        <div className="space-y-3">
          <Step num={1} title="Go to Portfolio > Paper Trading" page="/portfolio">
            Click the <strong className="t-primary">Paper Trading</strong> tab in your Portfolio page.
            You'll see your virtual balance and a "New Trade" button.
          </Step>
          <Step num={2} title="Place your first trade">
            Click <strong className="t-primary">"New Trade"</strong>, select <strong className="text-bullish">Buy</strong>,
            search for a stock (e.g., "AAPL"), enter how many shares (start with 10-50), and click Buy.
            The price auto-fills with the current market price.
          </Step>
          <Step num={3} title="Journal your reasoning">
            Before clicking Buy, expand <strong className="t-primary">"Journal Details"</strong>. Pick your
            strategy (Momentum, Value, Breakout, etc.), your emotional state (Confident, Anxious, FOMO, etc.),
            and write WHY you're making this trade. This is the most important part for learning.
          </Step>
          <Step num={4} title="Watch your positions">
            Your open positions show up in a table with real-time P&L. Watch how prices move over days and weeks.
            Notice how it feels when a position goes green vs red — managing those emotions is key.
          </Step>
          <Step num={5} title="Close when ready">
            Click <strong className="text-bearish">"Close"</strong> on any position to sell at the current price.
            Your profit or loss is locked in and the trade moves to "Closed Trades".
          </Step>
          <Step num={6} title="Review and learn">
            After closing, click <strong className="text-accent-light">"Review"</strong> on the closed trade.
            Rate the trade 1-5, write what you learned, and mark whether you'd repeat it.
            Over time, patterns emerge — you'll discover what works for YOU.
          </Step>
          <Step num={7} title="Check Journal Analytics">
            Switch to the <strong className="t-primary">"Journal Analytics"</strong> sub-tab.
            See charts showing your win rate by strategy, performance by emotional state, and streaks.
            This tells you: "I win more when Disciplined, lose more when trading on FOMO."
          </Step>
        </div>
        <Tip>
          Paper trade for <strong className="t-primary">at least 2-3 months</strong> and make at least 20-30 trades
          before using real money. If your paper trading win rate is below 50%, keep practicing — you're not ready yet.

          </Step>
          <Step num={2} title="Monitor your P&L">
            The dashboard shows your <strong className="text-bullish">total profit/loss</strong> in both dollars
            and percentage. Each stock shows individual P&L so you know which picks are working and which aren't.
          </Step>
          <Step num={3} title="Check your allocation">
            The <strong className="t-primary">pie chart</strong> shows how concentrated your portfolio is.
            If one stock is more than 20-25% of your portfolio, you're taking on concentration risk.
            Diversify across 5-10 stocks minimum.
          </Step>
          <Step num={4} title="Read the correlation matrix">
            If you hold 2+ stocks, a correlation heatmap appears. Values near <strong className="text-bullish">+1</strong> mean
            stocks move together (less diversification). Near <strong className="t-muted">0</strong> = independent.
            Near <strong className="text-bearish">-1</strong> = they move opposite (great hedge).
            Aim for a mix of low-correlated stocks.
          </Step>
          <Step num={5} title="Check average score">
            The <strong className="t-primary">Avg Score</strong> card shows the health of your overall portfolio.
            Score 60+ = healthy picks. Below 40 = your portfolio may need attention.

          <Step num={2} title="Read the results">
            The backtest shows: how many stocks the strategy selects, their average 3-month and 1-year return,

          </Step>

            Switch between strategies to compare. Look for the one with the <strong className="text-bullish">highest win rate</strong> and
